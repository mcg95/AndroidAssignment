# AndroidAssignment

This was an assignment I did for my Android module in University when attending for my BSc in IT.
It is a food ordering and delivery application(2 in 1) which uses thirdparty libraries such as Google Places API, Waze, Firebase Firestore, Firebase Database and Firebase Auth services.

It allows users to order food and delivery riders to get a list of pending orders which they can pick and deliver. Navigation to the delivery location is done with the help of Waze.

Language: Java(Android)

Grade: A
